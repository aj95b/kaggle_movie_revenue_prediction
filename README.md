# kaggle_movie_revenue_prediction
In this competition, you're presented with metadata on over 7,000 past films from The Movie Database to try and predict their overall worldwide box office revenue. Data points provided include cast, crew, plot keywords, budget, posters, release dates, languages, production companies, and countries.
Since the data is mostly tabular, with variable in a dictionary that can be extracted as a vector, I used a Random Forest Regressor to predict the revenue from most lucrative features.
